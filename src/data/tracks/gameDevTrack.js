  totalWeeks: 5,
  
  vision: `The vision of this roadmap is to guide beginners through game development using two popular engines: Godot (a free, open-source 2D/3D engine) and Unity (a cross-platform engine known for being beginner-friendly). In 5 weeks, students will start by building simple games in Godot (a 2D platformer and a basic 3D shooter) and then switch to Unity for an advanced 2D multiplayer project. Each level builds on the previous one, giving practical experience in game mechanics, scripting, and deployment.`,
